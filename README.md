# Zomato-Food-Analysis
SQL for Data Insights| Python for preprocessing

In this project, I'll dive into a real-world dataset from Zomato, a prominent food ordering platform. Our goal is to clean and refine this dataset, conduct a comprehensive analysis, and extract valuable insights. Through this hands-on experience, I will learn the intricacies of data analysis using SQL, discover how to uncover the full potential of the dataset, and employ Python for effective data preprocessing to enhance future performance. This project will also illuminate the power of structured query language in extracting pertinent information from the database. It's a journey of real-world data exploration, analysis, and the quest for meaningful insights.
